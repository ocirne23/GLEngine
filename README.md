# GLEngine

A minimalistic C++11 framework to easily and efficiently render various 3D graphics.

* Before compiling extract GLEngine/libs.rar (github 50MB file size limit)
* Before running GLApp, run GLResourceBuilder

This project is split into 3 parts:
* GLApp: An application utilizing the GLEngine library to showcase and test functionality.
* GLEngine: Provides generic functionality like rendering, input and file IO.
* GLResourceBuilder: Preprocesses various assets for efficient runtime usage.

This project is mainly intended as a portfolio piece.
