# GLEngine

A minimalistic C++11/14 framework to easily and efficiently render various 3D graphics.
* Requires Visual Studio 2015
* Before compiling extract GLEngine/libs.rar (github 50MB file size limit)
* Before running GLApp, run GLResourceBuilder

This project is split into 3 parts:
* GLApp: An application utilizing the GLEngine library to showcase and test functionality.
* GLEngine: Provides generic functionality like rendering, input and file IO.
* GLResourceBuilder: Preprocesses various assets for efficient runtime usage.

This project is mainly intended as a portfolio piece.

The primairy goal of the code style is to reduce and make spotting errors easier. For example, rows of repetitive/similar assignments will  be alligned to spot missing/duplicate/wrong lines.
